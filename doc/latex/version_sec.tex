New operations are now available: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item discounting() : This function corresponds to the classical discounting operation. The lost belief is transferred on the complete universe. \item $\ast$Combination() and full$\ast$Combination() : These functions implements the different combination rules proposed in the belief functions framework Two functions have been modified: combination() and fullCombination(). They now take an argument concerning the type of combination rule to use.\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{version_sec_v03_subsec}{}\section{V0.3}\label{version_sec_v03_subsec}
Name of operations have been corrected. The implementation of sets has been optimized a lot (exec time divided by 2 and a lot of memory saved). The implementation is totally mem-\/check free (checked with Valgrind) !\hypertarget{version_sec_v03_1_subsec}{}\section{V0.3.1}\label{version_sec_v03_1_subsec}
An emulation of namespace has been added in modules for function names. Minor bugs have been corrected.\hypertarget{version_sec_v03_2_subsec}{}\section{V0.3.2}\label{version_sec_v03_2_subsec}
The pure BFT has been separated from the application with sensors. Thus, the belief building from sensor measures has been put in a new specific file called BeliefsFromSensors(.h and .c).\hypertarget{version_sec_v04_subsec}{}\section{V0.4}\label{version_sec_v04_subsec}
New functionalities: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Options: It is now possible to add options to the belief model adding a file called 'options' with the files containing the points for sets of belief functions. The file should contain one option per line composed of a name of option and a float parameter. Only variation and tempo are now available. \item Decision support functions: those functions implemented in BeliefFunctions module enable to find a max or a min of a belief function for mass, belief and plausibility. The implementation is totally mem-\/check free (checked with Valgrind) !\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{version_sec_v04_1_subsec}{}\section{V0.4.1}\label{version_sec_v04_1_subsec}
Correction of the function used to measure time in the tempo option. (Use of clock\_\-gettime(CLOCK\_\-REALTIME,...) now) \par
 Adding \hyperlink{_sets_8c_a7693e000c2760240139628cd1b33d2f1}{Sets\_\-elementToBitString()} in Sets module. \par
 Adding the DEBUG, CHECK\_\-SUM and CHECK\_\-VALUES defines in \hyperlink{config_8h}{config.h} to customize the compilation and optimize a little more the execution time. \par
 The implementation is totally mem-\/check free (checked with Valgrind) !\hypertarget{version_sec_v04_2_subsec}{}\section{V0.4.2}\label{version_sec_v04_2_subsec}
Adding \hyperlink{_sets_8c_ab9ee97ae54608f3fb5784b29503d62b6}{Sets\_\-elementFromNumber()} and \hyperlink{_sets_8c_a71aeb52bad651c5129b57d7e69e5f480}{Sets\_\-numberFromElement()} in Sets module. \par
 Correction of a bug in the function \hyperlink{_sets_8c_a7693e000c2760240139628cd1b33d2f1}{Sets\_\-elementToBitString()}. \par
 Addition of a function \hyperlink{_sets_8c_a76fd7c759c8e24d17fdc240cc003c969}{Sets\_\-setToBitString()}. \par
 Separation of the temporization in a new function BFS\_\-temporization() instead of doing it directly in \hyperlink{_beliefs_from_sensors_8c_a0e545c6a35093eb43b27325db61c2216}{BFS\_\-getProjection()}. \par
 Code of the function \hyperlink{_beliefs_from_sensors_8c_a0e545c6a35093eb43b27325db61c2216}{BFS\_\-getProjection()} cleaned up. \par
 In \hyperlink{_beliefs_from_sensors_8c_a0e545c6a35093eb43b27325db61c2216}{BFS\_\-getProjection()}, if sensorMeasure == WEIRD\_\-NUMBER, then the projection equals the vacuous belief function. The temporization is done anyway. It's really usefull if you replace a lost measure by this WEIRD\_\-NUMBER because you'll get the vacuous or a trace of the last belief using the temporization. \par
 The BeliefFunctions module has been cleaned of all the \char`\"{}elementSize\char`\"{} by putting this variable inside the \hyperlink{struct_b_f___belief_function}{BF\_\-BeliefFunction} structure. \par
 Diverse things have been renamed to be more explicit and/or more convenient for the extension of the library. \par
 The implementation is totally mem-\/check free (checked with Valgrind) ! \par
\hypertarget{version_sec_v05_subsec}{}\section{V0.5}\label{version_sec_v05_subsec}
Addition of a new applicative module BeliefsFromBeliefs. \par
 Minor changes in diverse modules (that's the spirit of uncertain modification :)). \par
 Addition of a new function to clean the \hyperlink{struct_b_f___belief_function}{BF\_\-BeliefFunction} of non-\/focal elements. \par
 Addition of a new way of doing temporization using Dubois \& Prade's combination rule instead of a discrimination based on specificity. \par
 In the module BeliefsFromSensors, the options are now managed using flags, thus it should be easier to add and manage new options! \par
 The implementation is totally mem-\/check free (checked with Valgrind) ! \par
\hypertarget{version_sec_v051_subsec}{}\section{V0.5.1}\label{version_sec_v051_subsec}
Addition of a new function to normalize the BF\_\-BeliefFunctions. \par
 Addition of a new applicative module BeliefsFromRandomness (in progress...) \par
 Some things have been renamed to be more explicit. \par
 No more warnings! (compiling well with -\/Wall -\/Wextra -\/Werror -\/pedantic) \par
 In \hyperlink{_beliefs_from_sensors_8h}{BeliefsFromSensors.h}, a new define has been added to enable the use of different clocks for the temporization. It is useful when working on diverse OS implementing different clocks. \par
 Some combination rules have been reimplemented to increase performance and this is much better ! (I got rid of the dirty code of the beginning of the project...) \par
 The implementation is totally mem-\/check free (checked with Valgrind) ! \par
