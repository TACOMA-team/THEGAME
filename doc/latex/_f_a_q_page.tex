As sometimes, we got a question, the frequently asked question section may contain the answer we are looking for.\hypertarget{_f_a_q_page_FAQ_character}{}\section{The names of my states are badly cut or contain $^\wedge$\-M characters}\label{_f_a_q_page_FAQ_character}
This is due to the end of line character difference between Windows and Linux/\-Mac\-O\-S. It counts for two characters on certain systems and for only one on others. To correct this, you can try to compile with another system variable (W\-I\-N\-D\-O\-W\-S or L\-I\-N\-U\-X).

For Linux users, it is also possible to get a package called \char`\"{}tofrodos\char`\"{} which enables to convert files from windows to linux format and vice versa.\hypertarget{_f_a_q_page_FAQ_contact}{}\section{Contact}\label{_f_a_q_page_FAQ_contact}
