To compile:
 - check for the diverse variables in config.h
 - do "make"

The given main launches a ton of tests to check if everything is okay. 
Replace it by what you want and update the makefile if needed.

Please, check the documentation for the way to use this little library, 
get the references and the version notes. If it is not up to date, you
can generate it using Doxygen and the file "Doxyfile - doc options" in
the directory doc/.

The config.h file is used to customize what you need. Look for it!
